Step 1: Create a Table
We'll create an EMPLOYEES table to store employee information.


command 1 ==>	CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEES (
    		EMP_ID NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    		EMP_NAME VARCHAR2(100),
    		SALARY NUMBER
		);

Step 2: Create a Sequence
Next, we will create a sequence to automatically generate unique employee IDs.


command 2 ==>	CREATE SEQUENCE EMPLOYEE_SEQ
		START WITH 1
		INCREMENT BY 1;



Step 3: Insert Data Using the Sequence
Now, we can insert employee records into the EMPLOYEES table using the sequence for the EMP_ID.


command 3 ==>	INSERT INTO EMPLOYEES (EMP_ID, EMP_NAME, SALARY) VALUES (EMPLOYEE_SEQ.NEXTVAL, 'Alice', 5000);
		INSERT INTO EMPLOYEES (EMP_ID, EMP_NAME, SALARY) VALUES (EMPLOYEE_SEQ.NEXTVAL, 'Bob', 6000);
		INSERT INTO EMPLOYEES (EMP_ID, EMP_NAME, SALARY) VALUES (EMPLOYEE_SEQ.NEXTVAL, 'Charlie', 5500);
		INSERT INTO EMPLOYEES (EMP_ID, EMP_NAME, SALARY) VALUES (EMPLOYEE_SEQ.NEXTVAL, 'David', 7000);
		INSERT INTO EMPLOYEES (EMP_ID, EMP_NAME, SALARY) VALUES (EMPLOYEE_SEQ.NEXTVAL, 'Eva', 6500);

Step 4: Create a View
Next, weâ€™ll create a view to display employee names and their salaries. A view allows you to simplify complex queries or provide a more user-friendly way to interact with the data.


command 4 ==>	CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW EMPLOYEE_VIEW AS
		SELECT EMP_NAME, SALARY
		FROM EMPLOYEES;


Step 5: Query the View
You can now query the view to see the employees and their salaries:


command 5 ==>	SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE_VIEW;
